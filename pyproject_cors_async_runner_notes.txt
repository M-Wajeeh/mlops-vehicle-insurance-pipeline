PYPROJECT.TOML – EXPLANATION
=================================

1. What is pyproject.toml?
--------------------------
pyproject.toml is like an ID card for your Python project.
It tells Python:
- Project name
- Version
- Dependencies
- How the project should be built

TOML is just a clean and readable configuration format.


2. Why pyproject.toml is important
---------------------------------
Earlier, everything was handled using setup.py, which was Python code and could get messy.

pyproject.toml was introduced to:
- Modernize Python packaging
- Separate configuration from code
- Make dependency and build management cleaner
- Support multiple build tools (setuptools, poetry, etc.)

In short: it is the new standard.


3. Important sections in pyproject.toml
---------------------------------------

[project]
- Basic project information
- name, version, description, authors

[tool.setuptools]
- Tells Python that setuptools is used as the build tool

[tool.setuptools.dynamic]
- Allows dependencies to be read from another file
- Example: requirements.txt
- Avoids repeating dependency lists


4. setup.py after pyproject.toml
--------------------------------
setup.py is no longer the main file for metadata.

Now:
- Metadata → pyproject.toml
- Dependencies → pyproject.toml (or linked files)
- setup.py → optional, only for complex/custom builds

For most ML, FastAPI, or MLOps projects, setup.py is minimal or not needed.


5. How pyproject.toml, setup.py, and requirements.txt work together
-------------------------------------------------------------------
requirements.txt:
- Lists all project dependencies
- Used with: pip install -r requirements.txt

pyproject.toml:
- Central configuration file
- Can reference requirements.txt for dependencies

setup.py:
- Optional helper for custom build logic


CROSS-ORIGIN RESOURCE SHARING (CORS)
===================================
Browsers block requests between different origins (domain, port, protocol) by default.

Example:
Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend:  http://localhost:8000

CORS decides whether this connection is allowed.

allow_origins = ["*"]
Means:
- Any frontend can access the backend
- Useful for development and testing
- Should be restricted in production


ASYNC AND AWAIT (SIMPLE EXPLANATION)
===================================
async allows a function to pause while waiting without blocking the entire app.

await pauses only that function while other tasks continue running.

Example:
async def get_vehicle_data():
    form = await request.form()

Benefits:
- Faster handling of multiple users
- Efficient for APIs, databases, and network calls


GITHUB SELF-HOSTED RUNNER (EC2)
==============================

Problem:
Running ./run.sh starts the runner in the terminal foreground.
If the terminal closes or EC2 restarts, the runner stops.

Solution:
Run the runner as a service.

Steps:
1. cd ~/actions-runner
2. sudo ./svc.sh install
3. sudo ./svc.sh start
4. sudo ./svc.sh status
5. sudo systemctl enable actions.runner.<runner-name>.service

Result:
- Runner runs in the background
- Automatically starts after reboot
